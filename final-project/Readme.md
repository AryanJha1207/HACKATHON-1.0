# Project Overview
We developed a complete, multi-page website for TechFest 2025, our college's annual technical festival. The website features a modern, responsive design with interactive elements, event registration system, sponsor showcase, and detailed event pages - all built using only HTML and CSS.

# Objective
Our primary goal was to create a professional, fully-functional website that effectively showcases TechFest 2025 events while demonstrating advanced web development skills without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks. We aimed to deliver an excellent user experience across all devices with a consistent, visually appealing design.

# Features Implemented
- Responsive Design - Perfectly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Multiple Pages - Homepage, event details, registration, and sponsors sections
- Interactive Elements - Hover effects, smooth animations, and transitions
- Professional UI - Modern orange and purple color scheme with clean layouts
- Form Validation - Working registration forms with CSS-based validation
- Consistent Branding - Unified design language across all pages

# Challenges Faced
- Creating dynamic interactions and animations using only CSS
- Ensuring perfect responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- Managing form validation and user feedback without JavaScript
- Coordinating design consistency across multiple team members
- Meeting the tight hackathon deadline while maintaining code quality
- Implementing complex layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox

# Team Experience
Participating in this hackathon was an incredibly rewarding experience for our team. We enjoyed the collaborative process of brainstorming design ideas, solving technical challenges together, and seeing our individual contributions come together into a complete, polished website. The opportunity to work under pressure taught us valuable lessons in time management, communication, and technical problem-solving. Most importantly, we strengthened our teamwork skills and created something we're genuinely proud of as a group.
